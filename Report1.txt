Modular Robots 

- already done: independent blocks, connect blocks in a line
- find adequate data structure for shape generation
	- for specifying a shape
	- for imposing constraints
- generate shapes based on an input
- randomly generate shapes based on constraints

generate shapes based on input:
- start with matrix as input first
- if blocks are next to each other then they are connected
- can be connected to up to 6 blocks
- one has to be connected to power (different type of block)
- blocks can have property back, front, left, right, top, bottom?


classes
- 2 types of blocks; power or no power
